# webcam-ml
Real-time image classification using your webcam with tensorflow.js

Getting Started




Notes:

.idea:
1. Enable free text classes to easily label the examples I'm capturing
2. If I could connect the webcam to other video capture devices (i.e. my phone)
3. To easily "sign in" with a code to update an online stored model
   1. So that any time I go to the site, I can enter my code and the app will download the cloud storage model associated with that code. Then you may use the app to update it, and then save your progress. When saved the app will update the model weights in the cloud associated with that code and close. No authentication or sign in required.
4. Ability view, and download class labels associated with the "sign in" code. So that I can see all the classes I've "Tagged" throughout my time using the app.
